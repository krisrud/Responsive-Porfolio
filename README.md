# Responsive-Porfolio-site
This is a study project for my Nanodegree program. I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website displaing images, descriptions and links to each of the projects completed throughout the course of the Nanodegree program.
